# HW12 
Based on my final project, I experimented with the second idea. Although I am not yet certain whether I will choose this as the final option, it provided a great opportunity to exercise connecting p5.js and Arduino.

I am grateful for the professor's suggestions in the feedback. I attempted to create a potentiometer in Arduino to change the color of the screen. By collecting data from the potentiometer, I connected it to the RGB values of the screen in p5.js.

I think the tutorial is really helpful for me, I tried to use it as a template and change values in it to fit my project.
